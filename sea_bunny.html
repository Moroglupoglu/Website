          <p>Sea bunnies have become an internet craze, especially in Japan. It's really not difficult to see why. The resemblence to their land-faring namesakes is uncanny, however, the 'ears' and 'tail' have very different functions for the sea slug. The two feathery protrusions at the front are actually sensory organs called rhinophores. These are able to detect chemicals in sea water to help the sea bunny find food and potential mates. The fluffy tail-like cluster at its rear end are the sea slugs gills. This gives sea slugs their formal name: 'nudibranch' which means 'naked gill' in Latin. Sea bunnies are tiny, only a couple of centimetres long. Click on the link below to see a sea bunny in action:  <br><a href="images/sea_bunny.mp4" target = "_blank"> Sea bunny in action<a></a></p>
