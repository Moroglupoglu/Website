  <p>This site is an exercise in coding with HTML and CSS. My aim is to create pages which are simple and uncluttered. There is a section about sea slugs, which is one of my interests. If you want to know more about sea slugs, there are some links on my 'contacts' page.<br><br>Click on the links on the right or from the menu at the top for further information.<p>
