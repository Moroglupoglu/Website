      <p>I remember being completely facinated seeing these on the television. I think it was a David Attenburgh programme. These sea slugs are relatively massive. Adults can be between a foot and a half to two feet long. As you can see, they are brightly coloured, but they usually crawl aong the sea bed. When disturbed, they swim in their characteristic way, which gives them their name. Click on the link Below to see a video:</p>
