      <p class = "speech"> "Marek! It’s arrived! It’s here! Quick!”</p>
      <p class = "speech"> “What’s arrived, Paul, you lunatic. What are you going on about now!”</p>
      <p class = "speech"> “The mainframe. Tarmac has given an IBM mainframe to the school and it’s just arrived!”</p>
      <p> Paul was an archetypal 80s geek. Painfully skinny, thick glasses, very slightly protruding front teeth, wiry hair and a strange croaky voice. He lives in Hong Kong now a senior consultant for some communications/ media firm. His first job was working for BT in the early 1990s setting up links with satellites streaming the first Sky tv broadcasts. I shared a lot of his interests at school, but ended up going in a completely different direction.
      
      <p>We had difficulty controlling the CPUs passage along the school corridor. The thing was as big as a large fridge freezer and the castors needed oiling. Eventually, we reached the computer room, cackling with delight. We had already moved the terminal and the teletype machine, which was in a separate room: more of a cupboard really. There was also a teletype punching machine with a separate terminal. </p>
      
      <p class = "speech">  “Look at this, Marek. It’s a hard disk drive.”</p>
            
      <p>I’d never seen one before. It was in a large box on top of the CPU with a transparent lid with hinges.
      
        <p class = "speech"> “Two megabytes. Not kilobytes, megabytes! Just think. Two million bytes. Enough to store a whole book!”</p>
      
      <p class = "speech"> “What are all these switches for on the front of the computer?” I asked.</p>
      
      <p class = "speech"> “They’re for booting up the computer. It’s computer slang. The computer has to pull itself up by its bootstraps. Each switch is a one or a zero. You have to load up its first program in binary when you switch it on. Nothing will work until you do that.”</p>
      
        <p>After connecting up the various peripherals and plugging in the mains, it was time to switch on. The lights dimmed slightly as various fans whirred into action and LEDs began to flash. We laughed and nearly wet ourselves as gobbledygook, appeared on the terminal screen. We didn’t realise until about a week later that a vital i/o board was missing, so the whole thing was completely useless.</p>
      
    <p>As I was growing up, computing was such a new and exciting business. Inspired by television programmes at the time, I remember drawing pictures of computers at primary school. Behemoths with lights, rows of buttons and switches, reel to reel tapes and card print outs. There was huge excitement when my older brother bought one of the first electronic calculators when he went to secondary school; he was one on the last of his generation to learn to use a slide rule. I was even more fascinated when he got a programmable calculator. A Texas Instruments TI57. I got a cheaper Commodore calculator a year or so later. His TI57 had a memory of about 50 keystrokes, mine had 30 or so. I still remember some of the commands. LRN (Learn) to start programming, Goto for a crude loop, SKZ (Skip if zero), etc. Enough to input a formula for quadratic equation. Any mistake, and the thing would crash, and you would have to switch it off and on again.</p>

        As time went on, I saw the emergence of the Commodore PET, BBC model B and Commodore 64, which my younger brother acquired as a young teenager. Most teens could write a few lines of BASIC to get their name to scroll down the screen on typing the RUN command. We used to sometimes spend a couple of hours copying the code from a computer magazine to make a game and save it to cassette tape. Some of the games from that period retain a certain charm.’ Revenge of the Mutant Camels’ with Jeff Minter’s trademark scrolling backgrounds. These weren’t written in BASIC, but the mysterious assembly language. How else could you squeeze animated graphics and several game levels onto 32K of memory?
        <p>
          After completing a music degree in 1989, I enrolled for a PGdip/ MSc in Music technology. Computers had moved on a bit. We used Atari STs, which were great for music, because they had a built in MIDI interface for connecting to keyboards. Later in the year we were to complete a project using the strangely named C programming language.... to do what exactly? It was difficult to get anything done. We used a release called ‘Lattice C’, a pirated version as the legit version was a couple of hundred pounds. The lecturer told us early on that he would break our legs if we told anyone. These were the days when floppy disks were king. You had swap out the floppy disk where your code was stored and insert in its place the one with the C compiler/ linker.  Inevitably, the computer would crash at some point, and you would have to restart. It was all very frustrating. 
        <p>
        Other exciting developments included the Composers Desktop Project (CDP). You could record your music directly onto hard disk and manipulate it. This was a massive deal back then. Someone had lent a Fairlight computer to the University earlier that year. I think it might have been the great Peter Gabriel himself, as he was eventually awarded an honorary degree by the university. These would set you back £20,000 back then, more than the price of a semi-detached house. The cost of a CDP system was a fraction of this, and it could actually do a lot more. However, some projects were not carried out in real time and would have to run overnight, or even a few days. This was the first time I’d seen a screen saver. There was a real danger of the screen burning out. The cumbersome nature of the technology began to grate on me. I switched to the composing course.
        <p>
          Did this mean that I turned my back on IT? Not at all. I have rescued many a PC from waste disposal sites, dabbled in DOS, Microsoft QBasic, retaught myself a bit of C, tried C++ and nearly died. It’s been useful in my job as a supply teacher: 
          
          <p class = "speech"> “Computing teacher is off with a nervous breakdown; do you mind covering until half term? You’ll get the work provided.”</p>
          <p>Of course, nothing is provided. Actually, a for loop in python isn’t that different from the one in C. Using a few if…else statements, this class could probably manage to code a questionnaire. You can actually get jobs coding Python? There’s a course…?
